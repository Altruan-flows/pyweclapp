To replace all your assert statements in your Python package codes and properly validate function parameters, you should use exception handling and raise appropriate exceptions when parameter validation fails. Here's a guideline on how to do this:

Define Custom Exception Classes:
You can define custom exception classes for your package to make it more descriptive and user-friendly. These custom exceptions should inherit from the base Exception class or its subclasses like ValueError, TypeError, etc.

Example:

class InvalidParameterError(ValueError):
    pass
Replace assert Statements:
Instead of using assert, you should use if statements to validate function parameters, and if validation fails, raise a custom exception.

Example:

def my_function(param):
    if not isinstance(param, int):
        raise InvalidParameterError("Parameter 'param' must be an integer.")
    # Rest of the function logic
Add Descriptive Error Messages:
Ensure that the error messages in your custom exceptions are descriptive and provide information about why the validation failed. This will help developers using your package understand and debug issues more easily.

Handle Exceptions:
In the code that calls your package functions, wrap the function calls in a try-except block to catch and handle these exceptions.

Example:

try:
    result = my_function(some_param)
except InvalidParameterError as e:
    print(f"Invalid parameter: {e}")
By following these steps, you can replace assert statements with proper exception handling in your Python package codes, making it more robust and user-friendly. Additionally, it allows you to provide meaningful error messages to help users diagnose issues with their inputs.
