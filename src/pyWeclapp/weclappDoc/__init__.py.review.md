Overall, the code is mostly well-structured and clean. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. Ordering of Imports: Following Pep8 conventions, standard library imports should be at the top followed by related third party imports and then local application/library specific imports.

2. Exception Handling: In the function 'convertPdfToTiff', an import error exception is being raised for the package 'fitz'. However, instead of an AssertionError, an ImportError would make more sense. It conveys a clearer message about the type of the problem.

3. Single Responsibility Principle: Methods such as 'uploadFile' seem to be doing too much. They are handling multiple conditions (file, base64Content, buffer) and should ideally be split into smaller, more manageable methods that perform one task.

4. Redundancy: In the method 'uploadFile' after testing that 'file' exists, there is a redundant assignment operation 'file = file'.

5. Unnamed Constants: There are unnamed constants like 'pdf', 'all', 'latest' in the code which may make it difficult to understand what they refer to, it is good practice to assign such constants to variables with meaningful names.

6.  Error Message Consistency: The error messages are written in a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters with exclamation marks. They should be consistently structured, preferably with a standard capitalisation and without exclamation marks.

7. Unused variable - In the 'uploadFile' function, the variable 'demo' is declared but never used.

Spelling and file/method names seem correct and appropriately named, no errors found in this aspect.
