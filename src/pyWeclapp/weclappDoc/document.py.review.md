1. File name and method names:
   - There's a typo in the method `updateDescription`. In the log messages, `documet` is mistakenly written instead of `document`.
   - In the method `setDescription`, the variable `timestemp` is incorrectly spelled. It should be `timestamp`.

2. Code review:
   - In method `Document.__init__`, avoid commenting out code (e.g., `# handl old format`). Instead, remove it or clearly indicate why it remains in the script.
   - The initialization of the description seems quite complicated in the constructor `Document.__init__` and might cause issues. 
   - In method `Document.remotePrintJob`, the hardcoded `hardwareId` and `printer` parameter values might not be ideal in a production package. Consider making them as required parameters without default values or store them in a configuration file or environment variables.
   - In the same method, the commented-out `"weclappOsId"` line should be removed if it's not required.
   - In the `Document.downloadDoc` method, the docstring is misplaced. It should be at the start of the method.
   - The `EntityId` format validation in `fromWeclapp` method should be improved. Currently any string with a `.` in it would pass.
   - In method `Document.updateFile`, the `file` grammar can be improved. The line `file = file` is redundant and can be removed.
   - Documentation is lacking for most of the methods, which would make the package's API harder to understand and use by developers.
   - Exception handling in the `updateDescription` method seems a bit awkward, it logs an error and then raises an `AssertionError`, which is usually used for debugging and not as part of flow control. Consider using more specific exception types.
   - PEP 8 (Python's style guide) suggests imports should be grouped in the following order: standard library imports, related third party imports, local application/library specific imports. There is a blank line at the beginning which can be removed.
   - Magic numbers are used in the code like `9bbb119cf1ca8151aee3269930f5148af03c46d57610` and `HP_LaserJet_Pro_M404_M405_2`. Its better to assign these to some named constant and use the constant in the code for better readability.
   - The code end lines have multiple blank lines, it is suggested to have only one blank line at the end of the file according to PEP 8 standards.
   - There are random blank lines which need to be fixed. For example: at the beginning of the file and in the middle of the `Document` class declaration. 
   - The package relies heavily on the `pyWeclapp` package, but does not check if the services it needs are available or responsive. It should incorporate checks for the availability of required services and handle the exceptions gracefully if the services are unresponsive. Currently the errors are just logged and then the program could potentially crash. 
   - It would be helpful to have type hints for all method parameters and return types for better understanding and usage of the methods.
