1. Imports
```
import logging,  json, datetime
```
The `logging` and `datetime` modules are being imported but never used in the code. 

They should either be used or the import statements should be removed.

2. Allowed Values
There are spelling mistakes in `ALLOWED_DOC_TYPES`
```
ALLOWED_DOC_TYPES = ['anlage2', 'anlage4', 'signature', 'pod', 'reciept', 'tzmo_LS', 'reciept2', '-', "kkDoc", "abrechnung"]
```
The word `'reciept'` should be `'receipt'`. The correct variable's content should be:
```
ALLOWED_DOC_TYPES = ['anlage2', 'anlage4', 'signature', 'pod', 'receipt', 'tzmo_LS', 'receipt2', '-', "kkDoc", "abrechnung"]
```
It's similar for `ALLOWED_DOC_TYPES_LITERAL`. 

3. `setValue` method
The `setValue` method is not validating inputs. It is based on the assumption that `key` exists which might not be the case all the time, it's better to add checks for the existence of `key`.

4. Duplication
The `fromString` and `fromDict` methods seem to do similar operations. You might want to refactor the `fromDict` method to avoid potential repetitive code. 

5. Error Handling
The method `validateInput()` only validates the input but it doesn't handle it. There could be additional code to handle the case where the input is invalid, instead of simply raising an AssertionError. 

6. JSON Serialization
Some of DocDescription properties may not be JSON serializable in the `getDescriptionAsString()` method. It's advised to provide custom JSON encoder or proper pre-serialization to avoid any runtime problems.

7. Spellings
In `fromString` method's AssertionError, there is a typo. `'vaild'` should be `'valid'`. 

Corrected version is:
```
raise AssertionError(f">{description}< is not a valid json")
``` 

8. Overuse of `setattr`
The overuse of `setattr` might potentially be dangerous if uncontrolled, it could possibly overwrite existing methods. 

9. Uncontrolled `setattr`
In the `fromString` method, instead of directly assigning `key` to `dd`, it's better to validate if `key` is a valid attribute in the `DocDescription` class before assigning its value. 

10. There seems to be no error handling or checking for `version` attribute in `fromString`. It is being directly assigned. Users may send invalid inputs. 

11. Method's naming convention 
There is a method named `fromString`. For clarity, it may be better named to `from_string` following Python's naming convention to use lowercase words separated by underscores for function and method names.

12. Use of Type hinting 
There is inconsistent use of type hinting. Some of the method signatures do not have return type hinting while others do. For better maintainability and readability, it's good if the developer maintains consistency. 

13. Use isinstance instead of type equality
In `setValue` method, checking type by equality like `if to == datetime.datetime:` is not advised, it would be better to use `isinstance(value, datetime.datetime)` instead. 

The variable names, method names and file name spellings are all correct. There were just some typographical errors in the code, not the names.
