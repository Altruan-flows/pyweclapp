1. The class 'CommissionSalesPartners' seems to be duplicated in the code, which could lead to a potential error. 

2. The 'fromBlank()' method is used with 'DeliveryAddress', 'DeliveryEmailAddresses', 'EcommerceOrder', 'InvoiceAddress','RecordAddress', 'RecordEmailAddresses', 'SalesInvoiceEmailAddresses' but have not been defined within the corresponding classes.

3. A consistent use of either single or double quotes across the entire file would improve the code's readability.

4. A better type annotation is required for the following class attributes: 
- commissionFix, commissionPercentage in class CommissionSalesPartners are str but likely should be some type of numeric.
- the 'createdDate' and 'lastModifiedDate' data types in the classes CommissionSalesPartners, EcommerceOrder, and ProjectMembers are defined as integers whereas they generally tend to be datetime.
- deliveryAddress, deliveryEmailAddresses, ecommerceOrder, invoiceAddress, recordAddress, recordEmailAddresses, salesInvoiceEmailAddresses in SalesOrder class should have Optional[] as they are being initialised as None through the fromBlank() method.

5. There might be a lack of documentation making it hard to understand the purpose of these classes and their methods.

6. The names 'ITEMS_NAME' and 'USED_ATTRIBUTES' in all the classes are not Pythonic. The Pythonic way would be 'items_name' and 'used_attributes'.

Regarding spelling, the file name 'salesOrder_Model.py' and the class & method names seem to be spelled correctly. However, it's worth noting Python style guidelines usually recommend lowercase with underscores for file names (making it 'sales_order_model.py' instead). Furthermore, class names in Python typically follow the CapWords convention and the current code is following the convention correctly.
