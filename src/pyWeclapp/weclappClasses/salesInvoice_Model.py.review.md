1. The spelling of all filenames and methods appear correct.

Problematic segments:

1. The `CommissionSalesPartners` class is declared twice, which is an issue. Duplicate class declarations can cause confusion and unintended behavior in your code.

2. The `ITEMS_NAME` and `USED_ATTRIBUTES` variables are set to `None` or an empty dictionary in each class. If these are meant to be placeholders that will be updated with specific values later on, it may be beneficial to add comments or include these as arguments in the class initiation to explicitly highlight their intention.

3. Inappropriate use of `None` as a default value: `None` is used as a default value for all the optional class attributes(objects properties). Using `None` as a default value could lead to NullReferenceExceptions if not handled properly in the application code.

4. Incorrect use of mutable default value: Using mutable objects like list, dict as default arguments can lead to unexpected behavior because they persist between function/method calls.

5. Python's built-in `from typing import *` is typically considered poor design. It clutters the global name space and can make the code harder to understand. It should be switched out to import only the specific modules required.

6. For bigger scripts or where models are re-used, it would be beneficial to consider splitting the models into separate files for better maintainability.
   
7. No documentation: Comments and docstrings are missing throughout the code. Python coding best practices recommend to always document your code.

8. The model `SalesOrders` only contains an `id` field. If that is the intention, it's okay but if not, more details might need to be added.

9. Python typing: Consider replacing `str = None` with `Optional[str] = None` if the property can be a string or None. Similarly for the lists, they should be declared as `Optional[List[Type]] = None` where Type is the class or str, int, etc.
