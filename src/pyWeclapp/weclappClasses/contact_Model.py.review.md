1. The file name `contact_Model.py` should be in all lower case like `contact_model.py` to follow the Python convention.

2. Ensure that the `BaseModel` and `Blueprint` classes being imported and inherited from have appropriate error handling and initialization methods. 

3. The `pydantic` library is used to enforce type checking. Ensure that all the types for the BaseModel fields are correct. 

4. The `WeclappMetaData` class is used but not defined in this file, ensure it is defined elsewhere and correctly imported.

5. Be careful with mutable default arguments. `addresses: List[Addresses] = []` and similar declarations should be declared as follows to avoid shared state between instances: `addresses: Optional[List[Addresses]] = None`. 

6. Last but not least, `Addresses`, `OnlineAccounts`, and `Contact` class __init__ methods should call super instead of calling each of the parent's __init__ methods. For example, instead of calling `BaseModel.__init__(self, **kwargs)` and `Blueprint.__init__(self, self.ITEMS_NAME, self.USED_ATTRIBUTES)`, it should be `super().__init__(**kwargs)`.

7. Also assuming the `ITEMS_NAME` and `USED_ATTRIBUTES` are meant to be immutable class variable, they should be defined outside the `__init__` method and be named in all caps (according to PEP 8) to denote their status as constants. If they are meant to be assigned to individual instances, their names should be in lower snake case and they should be defined in the `__init__` method to avoid shared state between instances.

Here's an example of how the init should look:

```python
def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    self.items_name = None
    self.used_attributes = dict() 
    super().__init__(**kwargs)
```
