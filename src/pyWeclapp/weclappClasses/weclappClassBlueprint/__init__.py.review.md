The code is well written and largely obeys best practices. Here's what I found in terms of naming:

File and Method Names:
1. The method name `assesChanges` appears to be a typo, it's likely intended to be `assessChanges`.
2. The method `refershEntity` seems to be a typo; it should probably be `refreshEntity`.
3. The file name `weclappClassCustomAtt` could be more descriptive and is a bit shortened without any particular need . Consider using `weclappClassCustomAttribute`.

Code problems and suggestions:
1. `dict()` is used as the default value for `usedAtts` in the `__init__` method which is mutable and can lead to unexpected behavior. Default arguments in Python are evaluated only once, so if the dict changes at any run, the change will persist across function calls. Instead, consider using `usedAtts=None` and then `self.USED_ATTRIBUTES = usedAtts or dict()`.

2. There's an unclear comment for the `queryMetaData` method (`'''Dies Ist eine Klase, die nicht eigenst√§ndig vverwendet werden sollte'''`). This is written in German and it's not immediately clear what it means. Comments should be in English and clearly describe the function or class to provide clarity.

3. The if-else conditions in the `__setattr__` method looks too complex and could benefit from simplification or better comments to explain multiple logical branches.

4. The `incrementVersion` method blindly increments the version even when 'version' attribute does not exist. It should provide a warning if the attribute does not exist.

5. There are excessive empty lines in multiple places, it's better to remove them to make the code more readable and professionally formatted.

6. Rather than using `assert` to check for problems during development (which might be switched off in optimized bytecode), consider raising appropriate exceptions that can provide feedback even in production code.

7. Logging levels seem to be used inconsistently, sometimes errors are logged with `.warning` and other times with `.error`. Make sure to use the appropriate logging level.

8. There are multiple Python strings, integers and floats being used as default for the variable `updateType`. It would be more manageable to use named constants.

9. There is a potential infinite recursion in `assesChanges` method if the queried key doesn't exist in the sub-entity. It might lead to a stack overflow.

10. In `updateWeclapp`, update action is being performed without any prior checks. It is a good practice to ensure the entity exists before performing the update.  

11. Single character variable names like `el` in the for loop may harm the readability of the code. It's better to use descriptive variable names.
