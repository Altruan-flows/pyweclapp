8. Some assumptions are made about the input without checks. For example, `getValue` method assumes the inputted value could be converted into the desired format without checking. It would be a good practice to add checks on inputs to ensure that they meet specific prerequisites.

10. Strongly coupled methods: It seems that the methods in this class are very reliant on other methods behaving exactly as expected. A change in one method might break functionality in another. It would be advisable to reduce this coupling.

Please consider these points while incorporating fixes into the code.
