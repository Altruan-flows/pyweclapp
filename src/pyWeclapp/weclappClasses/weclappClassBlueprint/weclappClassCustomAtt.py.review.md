Upon examination, spelling or naming related issues found are:

1. Typo in `updateWeclapp` method, `entityId` argument should be `entityID`.
  
Other problems identified are:

1. Unused imports: The modules `weclapp` and `timeFunctions` are imported from `pyWeclapp` but aren't used anywhere in the code.
2. Variable shadowing: In the initialization of the `WeclappMetaData` class, variables are defined that shadow the class attributes. This could lead to confusing behavior.
3. Error handling: The exception handling could be improved. Some of the Pythonic ways to handle exceptions are not being used, such as not re-raising the exception after logging it in some places.
4. Methods complexity: Some methods such as `updated`, `getValue` might be simplified to improve readability and maintainability.
5. In `validateValue`, asserting the types of input value may not be the best way to check the input type, it would be better to include type checking logic.
6. Redundant comments: There's a big block of code commented out in the end. This should be removed if it's not to be used.
7. Unused parameters: `unselect` parameter in `setValue` function is not used.
8. Some assumptions are made about the input without checks. For example, `getValue` method assumes the inputted value could be converted into the desired format without checking. It would be a good practice to add checks on inputs to ensure that they meet specific prerequisites.
9. The code does not follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, e.g., same literal list of values is used multiple times.
10. Strongly coupled methods: It seems that the methods in this class are very reliant on other methods behaving exactly as expected. A change in one method might break functionality in another. It would be advisable to reduce this coupling.

Please consider these points while incorporating fixes into the code.
