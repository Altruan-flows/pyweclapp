Overall the code is clearly structured and rightly used the OO concepts with proper importing of modules. It is also properly following PEP8 guidelines for Python code styling. However, there are some issues and potential improvements:

1. The file is named `shipment_Model.py` which is not a standard Python naming convention. It is recommended to use `shipment_model.py` instead.

2. `dict = dict()` is creating a dictionary but it is not descriptive and is redeclaring a builtin type (`dict`) as a variable. It's better to have descriptive names for variables.

3. The `__setattr__` method of the `Blueprint` class is being assigned to the same method in each class. It will be safer if the `Blueprint` is designed as a Mixin class and incorporated into the inheritance list of each class. This would automatically buy these classes the `__setattr__` functionality along with other methods if they exist.

4. The method `fromBlank` in classes `InvoiceAddress`, `RecipientAddress`, `SalesInvoiceEmailAddresses`, `ShippedFromAddress`, and `RecordEmailAddresses` has not been defined within these classes.

5. All classes has the attributes `ITEMS_NAME` and `USED_ATTRIBUTES` initialized to `None` and a fallow dictionary respectively. Ensure these are intended to be default values and have these properly documented so it's clear for future users or maintainers of your code. The user of class may need to be aware of the purpose of these attributes and know how to use them.

6. There are no doctrings in any of the classes, methods, or the module itself. Doctrings are used for documentation and are very useful for understanding intent, functionality or the purpose of your classes and methods especially for other developers or future-you. 

7. BaseModel initialization and Blueprint initialization are being called separately in all classes.  One solution is to create a common base class that will inherit from `BaseModel` and `Blueprint` and let it handle the initialization (`__init__`) of both. All classes then will inherit from the common base class.

Example:

```python
class CommonBaseClass(BaseModel, Blueprint):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        BaseModel.__init__(self, **kwargs)
        Blueprint.__init__(self, self.ITEMS_NAME, self.USED_ATTRIBUTES)

class SomeClass(CommonBaseClass):
    """
    Other class specific codes here...
    """
    pass
```

8. While typing hints provide valuable information, the use of the wildcard import (`from typing import *`) could be more explicit with direct imports (ex: `from typing import List`).

9. If possible, try to reduce the size of the classes by shelving some attributes into other classes and making the structure hierarchical. The class `Shipment` has too many fields and may become hard to manage.

10. There's no error handling in your classes. You should anticipate cases where invalid data could be passed to your methods or attributes and how they should be handled properly.

Remember that the purpose of this evaluation is to provide you with an external view of your code, and does not mean that your code would not function properly as it is. It is up to you to decide which aspects to take into account and which are not necessary given your context.
