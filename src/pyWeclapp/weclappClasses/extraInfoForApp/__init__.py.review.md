Here are some potential issues with the above code:

1. Types of attributes for class `ExtraInfoForApp`: 
   The model has all attributes as `str` whereas some of them seem to represent numeric quantities (`confirmedOrderedQuantity`, `consignmentStockQuantity`, `currentYearRevenue`, etc.). Those should rather be `int` or `float`, depending upon whether you expect fractional values.

2. The class `ExtraInfoForApp` is subclassing Pydantic's `BaseModel` but it is also declaring its own `__init__` method that is calling `BaseModel.__init__`. Pydantic generally provides its own `__init__` method based on the model, so usually, there's no need to override it. Check if this is really necessary. If not, buddy can be removed.

3. In the `fromWeclapp` classmethod, before returning the class instance, it would be safer to add some error handling. What if there's some issue with the API response? Any errors in the API response should be handled gracefully.

4. In `fromArticle` classmethod, not all paths of logic return a class instance. If all if conditions fail - the method will not return anything. This could be an issue for other parts of code, so you should add a default return statement at the end. 

5. There is an extensive use of `setattr` and `getattr`. While these are acceptable in some cases, it's usually better to directly reference values where the set of attributes is known, as is the case here. Using `setattr` and `getattr` can make the code harder to follow.

6. Code readability: Instead of a nested if-else construction in `fromArticle`, using guard clauses could improve the readability of the code.

Regarding file and method names, there do not seem to be any spelling mistakes in the provided code snippet. We would need to check more files to accurately assess file and method naming.
