1. Import Statement: The first thing that is problematic is the wildcard import `from .localizedTime import *`. It's usually not good practice to use wildcard imports in Python as it could lead to conflicts with variable names and also it's unclear what exactly is being imported. You should only import the necessary functions or classes. Example: `from .localizedTime import parse`

2. Unused Dependencies: The `datetime` module is imported but is never used. 

3. Method Definitions: The method `timeDifferenceMonths(t1, t2)` parses `t1` and `t2`, which are expected to be of `datetime.datetime` type. 

4. Spell Check: File and function names are spelled correctly, there are no misspellings. However, the file name could use an underscore for better readability (time_functions).

Overall this piece of code seems incomplete and lacks coherence. For better clarity it might need additional context or information.
