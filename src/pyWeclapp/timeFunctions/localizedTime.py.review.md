Issues Found in the Code:
1. Typing `Literal` and `Union` from `typing` module are not being used correctly. They are supposed to represent a constrained type for the associated variable, i.e., it can have only specific values, not for defining optional parameters.
2. The default argument for time in the functions `parse` and `toStr` is mutable in nature. It is `time.time()*1000` which gets evaluated at the time of the function definition, not when the function is executed.
3. In the `parse` function, there is a section where if the input is not a `datetime.date`, a series of nested try-except clauses are used. This violates the principle of flatness (Flat is better than nested), which is one of the guidelines in the Zen of Python.
4. The `parse` function is using a catch-all exception clause, which is a bad practice. It makes debugging more difficult because it can hide unexpected errors.
5. In the `parse` function, a bare `except` clause is used right after a type conversion. This can potentially fail for other reasons, not only invalid values. It's always better to catch specific exceptions to properly handle different errors.
6. In the 'toStr' function, arguments like 'woo', and 'wooMeta' are mentioned but not processed in the function body. Additionally, the function has a default parameter 'weclapp' which is unknown.
7. Amount of repetition in 'toStr' function where there are multiple similar calls to `time.strftime`. This can be simplified using a dictionary mapping.

Spelling Mistakes in File and Methods Names:
1. File Name `pyWeclapp` should be `pyWeclapp`
2. Method name `toStr` in python we generally use full names `to_string` or `to_str`.
3. In the function `toUnix`, the parameter name 'timestemp' is misspelled, it should be 'timestamp'.
