Here are some problematic segments and possible misspellings in the code.

1. Typing for class attributes: In this code, class-level attributes are being assigned default values like None for str type, dict() for dict type and so on. In Python, the optional types should be used to indicate that a field can be None. 

2. Mutable default argument: In both `EntityReferences` and `Ticket` classes, default values for the lists `entityReferences`, `tags`, and `customAttributes` are set to an empty list `[]`. This can lead to unexpected behavior as default mutable objects in Python are shared between all objects.

Misspellings: 
No misspellings found in the file and method names. The names used are consistent and conform to Python naming conventions.

For problematic sections, here are some corrective actions:

1. You should use Optional in your typing for variables that default to None, according to PEP 484. For example:

```
from typing import Optional

entityId: Optional[str] = None
```

2. To avoid mutable default arguments, you can set them as None and create a new list in the function if None is provided:

```
from typing import List, Optional

customAttributes: Optional[List] = None

def __init__(self, customAttributes=None):
    if customAttributes is None:
        customAttributes = []
```

3. The use of Python's __setattr__ method is quite advanced and potentially risky. Be sure the original method doesn't need to run as well. If you need to extend `__setattr__`, call `super().__setattr__` within it. 

Please adjust these to make sure your code is clean, future-proof, and less prone to common pitfalls.
