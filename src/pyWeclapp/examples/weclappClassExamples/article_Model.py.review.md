Upon reviewing the provided code, below are some points identified that need considerations:

1. The classes in the code are not documented. Adding a docstring to the class will make the code easier to understand.

2. File and method names seem to be spelled correctly. No issues in that.

3. Python naming conventions are not strictly followed. Class names should be in CamelCase. For example, "ArticleAlternativeQuantities" is correctly named, but names like "article_Model.py" and "weclappClasses" don't follow this convention.

4. All classes are using BaseModel and Blueprint as parent classes. There are cases where they could create conflicts (if the '**kwargs' in the constructor contain some fields which are present in both the parent classes). A point to consider while reviewing the code.

5. All classes have '__init__' method which calls the '__init__' methods of its parents. This is usually not necessary as Python automatically calls these, unless there is a specific reason due to the usage of Blueprint class.

6. Mutable defaults might be used more safely. The way this code assigns certain values to empty lists or dictionaries directly could lead to problems. For example, "USED_ATTRIBUTES: dict = dict()" or "reductionAdditions: List[ReductionAdditions] = []" could potentially behave in ways not expected, as these are mutable. Default arguments in Python are evaluated once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. This means that if you use a mutable default argument and mutate it, you will, and have mutated that object for all future calls to the function as well.

7. The code repetition might be reduced. The classes in this code strictly follow a certain pattern and there may be potential for code reduction, either by abstracting out common structure into a base class or function.

8. Massive classes like the "Article" class may be broken down into smaller classes.

9. Typing is not used on all variables which could decrease code legibility and increase chance of bugs.

10. Type casting concerns. Variables such as 'createdDate', 'lastModifiedDate' are an integer but variables like 'minimumOrderQuantity', 'minimumStockQuantity' and 'targetStockQuantity' are treated as strings. This usage should be reassessed based on the real-world entity they are supposed to represent.

11. Some attributes may have unrealistic default values. If attributes are expected to be integers or booleans in all realistic scenarios, they should not default to 'None' as a string. For example, 'mainImage: bool' in the class `ArticleImages` defaults to None but it should be either True or False.
 
Overall, the code is quite clean and seems to be follows good design principles, but taking above points into consideration might improve it.
