1. Files and method names spelling are correct.

Problematic segments:

1. Duplicate class: The `CommissionSalesPartners` class is declared twice in the code. It should be defined only once.

2. Classes are missing corresponding `ITEMS_NAME` and `USED_ATTRIBUTES`.
      
   According to other similar classes' patterns in this code, the data attributes `ITEMS_NAME` and `USED_ATTRIBUTES` theoretically should be filled according to relevant data or fields instead of being `None` or `dict()`. But they are left as `None` or `dict()` in all classes.

3. Immutable data type for the default arguments: A mutable data type (`List` or `Dict`) is used as the default mutable argument in some classes (i.e., `Contract`, `ContractItems`, `AdditionalAddresses`, `CommissionSalesPartners` and `ContractCostItems`). It's notorious because Pythonâ€™s default arguments are evaluated once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. This could lead to unexpected behaviour like the default mutable argument changes each time the function is called. Consider using a safer alternative like `None`.

4. Not using optional type: In Python, the default way to make a data type optional is to use the Optional keyword (e.g. `Optional[str] = None`). This will make the code more clear and understandable.

5. The class 'Contract' has `tags: list = []` with a comment saying `# could not be parsed` indicating that there might have been an issue with getting the correct data for tags.
