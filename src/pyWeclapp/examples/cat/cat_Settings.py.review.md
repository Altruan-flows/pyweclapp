The code provided seems fine without any obvious logical or syntactical errors. However, here are some considerations pertaining to the structure and design.

1. There is no implementation in the `__init__` method. A comment is made about global settings, but it has no bearing on the script's functionality.

2. The 'data' argument is defined but not used, which may lead to potential confusion for users intending to provide a data dictionary.

3. The class and file name 'CAT_Settings' are not in the typical Python convention. Python class names typically use CamelCase (i.e., "CatSettings") and filenames are usually all lower case with underscores instead of dashes if required(i.e., 'cat_settings.py').

Apart from these, there is no misspelling in file and method names in this case. It's recommended to review these points and revise the structure or design of the code accordingly.
