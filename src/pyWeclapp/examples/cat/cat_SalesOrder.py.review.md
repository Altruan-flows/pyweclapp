Here are problematic segments found in the Python package:

1. Exception Handling:
The current exception handling in the `is_namedtuple()` method is incomplete. It's generally a bad practice to have a "blank" except clause as it may hide potential errors. Instead, define specific exceptions that you want to catch.

Here is the improved code:

```python
def is_namedtuple(obj):
    try:
        return isinstance(obj, tuple) and hasattr(obj, "_fields")
    except TypeError:
        return False
```

2. Redundant isinstance() Check:
In `is_namedtuple(obj)`, the `hasattr(obj, "_fields")` function returns `False` if `obj` is not a namedtuple. Therefore, the `isinstance(obj, tuple)` function is irrelevant. The improved version of this function would look like this:

```python
def is_namedtuple(obj):
    try:
        return hasattr(obj, "_fields")
    except TypeError:
        return False
```

3. Use of namedtuple:
In `__init__`, it should be noted that namedtuple objects are lightweight, new classes that subclass tuples but also allow named access to elements. However, the elements of namedtuple instances are still accessed using string literals, which may erode the benefits of using namedtuple in the first place. If you don't need named access to elements of `self.exampleAttribute`, consider using a regular tuple instead.

4. Readability of String Literals:
Readability can be improved by breaking the long line of code where `self.exampleAttribute` is defined, into multiple lines. This will make the code easier to manage and maintain.

5. Naming: It's unusual to find method and local variable names starting with capital letters in Python. Python's naming conventions (PEP 8) suggest lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability ('snake_case') for method and variable names.

Regarding spell-checking for file and method names, there doesn't appear to be any misspellings in the given code snippet. However, maintaining lower case letters for filenames (cat_salesorder.py instead of cat_SalesOrder.py), class names (CatSalesOrder instead of CAT_SalesOrder), and method names (is_named_tuple instead of is_namedtuple) would make the code more aligned to standard Python conventions.
