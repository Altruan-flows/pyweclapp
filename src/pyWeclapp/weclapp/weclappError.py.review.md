1. Misspellings: The Python package code is well spelled. However, in context of method names, "isOptimisticLoc" might be a mistake. It's likely the intended name is "isOptimisticLock".

2. The `self.url` attribute in `__init__` method: It's trimmed with `str(self.response.url)[41:]`. This may not work as expected if the URL's length is less than 41 characters. Additionally, this can lead to incorrect URL slicing if the base URL changes or has different lengths for different endpoints.

3. Implementation of user-defined exceptions: It seems that this class is used for handling different types of errors. Some of these might be better handled by using inheritance and creating subclasses for each specific error type.

4. The methods `isOptimisticLoc` and `hasWrongStatus` are implemented as properties, this obfuscates their function. These should be regular methods instead of being properties, as they do not indicate a property of an instance of the class but rather perform a check or an action.

5. Error messages such as "No detail Found" -> "No detail found", "No error Found" -> "No error found", "No title Found" -> "No title found", "No type Found" -> "No type found" would improve English grammar and readability.

6. Usage of `self.fullLog` in `__str__` method: It looks like whether a full log will be generated or not is decided by this attribute. But this attribute is never mutated in this class. The logic utilizing `self.fullLog` could potentially be refactored for clarity and efficiency. 

7. Structure of `self.messages` and `self.validationErrors`: The code assumes that `self.messages` is a list of dicts and that `self.validationErrors` is a list. This could potentially create issues if the data structure is ever different. The data structure should be verified before processing.

8. Logging in `isOptimisticLoc` and `hasWrongStatus`: Logging error messages in these methods might not be ideal since it's unclear where these methods will be used, and it might not always be appropriate to log these events every time these methods are called.
 
9. Use of 'f' in front of strings could potentially cause issues since it's not supported in Python versions below 3.6.

10. Usage of reserved word type as a variable `self.type` could potentially cause problems if trying to use Python's built-in `type()` function.

Overall, the package seems fine but some improvements could be made in terms of error handling structure and other minor grammar and code design improvements.
