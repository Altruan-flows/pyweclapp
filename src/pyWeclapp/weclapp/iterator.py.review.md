Here are some of the issues or area of improvements, I see in the code.

- "init Cariables" is a comment with a spelling mistake, it should be "init Variables"
- "prepare Querys" is a comment with a spelling mistake, it should be "prepare Queries"
- Avoid using broad 'except' clause. It is best to specify the exception types that are expected. If there is a need to log or handle all exceptions, then add a comment explaining the reasoning.
- `if log:` checks are repeated throughout the code, which is not a good practice. It is better to have a dedicated logger that can be configured to ignore certain levels of logs, that way you just write the log and the configuration decided whether it should be printed or not.
- The comment "# "responsibleUserFixed": "true", -> wird Ã¼ber query params upgedatet" is not in English, consider translating it for better understanding by all developers.
- The query dictionary does not need to be created in every loop iteration. 'pageSize' and 'page' are the only information being updated in each loop. Create the dictionary outside the loop and just update those two entries.
- In the comment '# yield all purchases of customer', 'purchases' seems to be wrongly used as we are not sure if the endpoint will result in purchases. Consider making the comment more generic like, # yield all requested records.
- You are not handling any exceptions such as `GET()` function failure, which could lead to process breaking abruptly. 
- Both "assert" statements are used for error checking, although it's not wrong, however, it would be better to use exception handling instead of assert statements. Since "assert" statements can be globally disabled with the '-O' and '-OO' command line switches, as well as the PYTHONOPTIMIZE environment variable in python. This can create a potential bug in your code.
- The GET function is imported from '.' but as per the typical Python coding convention, module names should be in lowercase. Please make sure to validate this.
- The way pagination control is implemented by limiting 'page' and 'stopAfterNPages' is not very efficient. You could utilize the API's own pagination logic, i.e., usually most APIs would return some sort of metadata indicating if there are more pages/results.

Regarding the filenames and method names, you didn't provide any besides 'iterator' which seems to be spelled correctly.
