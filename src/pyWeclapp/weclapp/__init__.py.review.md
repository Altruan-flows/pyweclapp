Upon review, the following issues were found in the code:

1. In the import statement `from .weclappResponseProcessing import AVAILABEL_APIKEYS`, the constant `AVAILABEL_APIKEYS` seems to be misspelled. It should probably be corrected to `AVAILABLE_APIKEYS`. 

2. In the functions `GET`, `PUT`, `POST` and `DELETE`, the default value for parameter `apiKey` spelled as `AVAILABEL_APIKEYS` should be corrected to `AVAILABLE_APIKEYS` assuming the import is corrected. 

3. The module `logging` is imported but not configured properly. It is generally a good idea to configure the root handler in the main entry point of your application and fine-tune the logging configuration of each module using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.

4. The error messages in the `assert` statements could be more descriptive. 

5. GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE functions take similar parameters and have similar structures. It might be an opportunity for refactoring, for instance using a helper function which takes HTTP method as parameter.

6. The logging level appears to be misplaced. In function `DELETE`, the line `logging.warning(f"DELETE - {URL=}")` should ideally be  `logging.info(f"DELETE - {URL=}")` given that this is expected behavior and not a warning scenario. This is the same case in `POST` function.

7. The `PUT` and `POST` methods convert the `body` parameter to JSON via `json.dumps()`, this could potentially raise a `TypeError` if the body isn't JSON serializable. It would be safer to handle this operation in a `try: except TypeError:` block.

8. In the `POST` method, the string check ` "document" in entityName` appears to be based on an implicit convention. It would be better if there was an explicit check to ensure the entity name is one of expected choices where a bytes body is allowable. 

9. For security and quality practices, there are missing docstrings which means there's non-existing documentation about what each function is supposed to do, what each parameter is supposed to be and what is expected to be returned.

10. The error handling could be improved. For instance, HTTP errors in the responses from requests could be handled within each of the GET, PUT, POST and DELETE methods and not just in `DELETE`.

11. The POST function logs a warning ("Bytes type Body for Post found!!!") if the request body is of the bytes type. However, it may not necessarily be a problem if it's already anticipated and handled in code.

12. The `DELETE` function logs the deletion of an item before the response is checked. This could lead to inaccurate logs if the delete request was unsuccessful. 

13. The `ignore:bool=True` argument in the `PUT` function is not fully explained or documented for use. This could lead to misuse or underuse of this argument.

14. It is not clear what the purpose of the commented line `# logging.info(body)` is in the `PUT` function. It is generally not a good practice to leave commented code in the codebase as it can confuse future readers or maintainers of the code. 

15. The `requests.adapters.DEFAULT_RETRIES = 5` line is commented out in the `POST` function. If retries are a planned or expected part of this function, this should be uncommented and potentially made flexible via an optional argument or configuration.

Please note that some issues may need more context or understanding about the package goals and constraints to be fully assessed. Also considering Python's focus on readability, methods name like GET, PUT, POST, DELETE should be lowercase according to PEP 8, Python's style guide.
