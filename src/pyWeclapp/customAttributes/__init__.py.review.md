I have identified several potentially problematic areas in the provided code. 

1. Variable Naming:
    - BlackDict is an ambiguous term.
    
2. Comprehensive commenting: The code isn't well-commented. It's essential to provide enough comments so that the code's further maintainability or readability isn't impacted.

3. Exception handling:
    - There is a bare except in the `save()` method. This is generally a bad practice as it can hide bugs and make debugging difficult.

4. Dependencies between functions:
    - The `main()` method has a fixed sequence of executing other methods. This introduces a dependency between the functions, making it hard to unit test them separately.


5. Use of assert: In the `save()` method, an assert statement is being used. In Python, assert statements can be globally disabled with the -O and -OO command line switches, as well as the PYTHONOPTIMIZE environment variable in CPython. It leads to potentially risky situations where bugs are unnoticed because assert statements are not executed in production environments.

6. TestUtils: Some of the utility functions (such as the one that checks whether something is a namedtuple) are not necessarily related to the class `CAT_Generator`. Therefore, these might be better placed in a utility module.

7. Use of `main()` method: `main()` is generally reserved for the entry point of a program, not a class. Because of this, it might be more idiomatic Python to name the function something else or to put its contents into `__init__()` directly.

Spell check:

1. `citty` should probably be `city` in the file `citty`.
