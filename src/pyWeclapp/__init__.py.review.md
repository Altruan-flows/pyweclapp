This piece of Python code seems clear and without obvious issues. However, some considerations necessary for a comprehensive code review, which depend on more context and cannot be definitively answered from this code snippet alone, include:

1. Confirm that the right modules are being imported for required functionality. This is difficult to assess without understanding the overall package and functionality expectations better.
2. Confirm the commented import is intentionally commented, and it's not a mistake. Usually, leftover commented-out code should be removed to make the code base cleaner.
3. Assess whether the piece of code respects the general structure and organisation of the rest of the project, and respects naming conventions. This too is difficult to tell from the code snippet alone.

In terms of spellchecking, all the file names and method names seem to be spelled correctly, assuming those are the correct function and module names in use within the project. Do note that, while they aren't spelling errors, the best Python coding practice is to use snake_case for filenames, function names, and variable names, so file names like `weclappClasses` should ideally be `weclapp_classes` as per Python naming conventions. 

Finally, confirm there are no circular imports, which can cause issues at runtime. The circular import problem can happen if "weclapp", "weclappClasses", "weclappDoc", "timeFunctions", and "customAttributes" are also importing `__init__.py`, directly or indirectly. This might not be apparent from this code snippet alone and you may need to check these files.
